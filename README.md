# CityBike
NY CityBike project with 2022 year data
<h2 id="data-visualization-with-python-creating-a-strategic-dashboard">Data Visualization with Python: Creating a Strategic Dashboard</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p> Imagine you’re the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA. Your
 team has been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help the business strategy department
 assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion
 opportunities.</p>
<p> The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover
 actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will
 circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly
 transportation solutions in the city.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p> For this project, you’ll be using public data from New York bike-sharing facilities operated by Citi
 Bike. For context, Citi Bike’s popularity has increased since its launch in 2013. The company’s
 marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of
 transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York
 residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to
 distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked
 bikes, making it difficult to return a hired bike—and customer complaints.</p>
<p> As the lead analyst, your task is to diagnose where distribution issues stem from and advise
 higher management on a solution based on your diagnosis of the root of the problem—whether
 it’s sheer numbers, seasonal demand, or something else. Being in a management position also
 makes you the bridge between divisions, which requires you to ensure the information is
 tangible for the business development team. To effectively communicate your analysis to
 non-analysts, you’ll present your insights in an interactive dashboard depicting the metrics you
 identify as vital for tackling the distribution issues.</p>
<h3 id="data-and-tool-requirements">Data and Tool Requirements</h3>
<p> For this project, you’ll use open source data from the Citi Bike database for the year 2022. To
 enrich this data set, you’ll gather weather data using NOAA’s API service. You will then use
 Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to make charts; pandas and Kepler.gl,
 to create maps; and Streamlit to design your final dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="data-sourcing-criteria">Data Sourcing Criteria</h3>
<p> ● Download an open-source data set from Citi Bike for the year 2022;</p>
<p> ● Gather weather data for the year 2022 using NOAA’s API.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-criteria">Analysis Criteria</h3>
<p> ● Use descriptive analysis and apply aggregations of bike trips across New York to
 discover the most popular starting locations and summarize data yearly to find seasonal
 patterns.</p>
<p> ● Apply geographic plotting to identify problem areas in station distribution and explore
 the most common routes.</p>
<h3 id="visualization-criteria">Visualization Criteria</h3>
<p> ● Create dashboard in Python to showcase the findings of your analysis. The dashboard
 should be divided into sections based on the variables affecting demand.</p>
<p> ● Each graph should be visually appealing and refined using a color palette in Python.</p>
<p> ● The dashboard should contain an introduction to set up the presentation, a slide for each
 graph to avoid overwhelming the audience, and a recommendations page that clearly
 explains the outcomes of the analysis.</p>
<h3 id="success-factors">Success Factors</h3>
<p> ● Present an interactive dashboard that depicts all the problematic aspects of bike
 logistics around the city.</p>
<p> ● Your dashboard contains visualizations that seek to understand the different factors that
 could affect the business.</p>
<p> ● You present strategy recommendations and next steps based on your findings.</p>
<h3 id="project-deliverables">Project Deliverables</h3>
<p> Throughout this Achievement, you’ll work from Exercise to Exercise to complete your project.
 For each Exercise task, you’ll submit a deliverable that directly contributes to the final
 product—in this case, a network visualization.</p>
